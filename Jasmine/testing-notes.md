# Objectives
- Understand what Jasmine and unit testing are
- Define 'describe', 'it', 'matchers' and 'spies'
- Write better tests with 'before' and 'after' hooks
- Write async tests with 'clocks' and 'done' callbacks
- Compare and contrast 'TDD' and 'BDD' testing styles and differentiate between unit and other kinds of tests

# Unit Tests
- These test parts of an application (aka units)
- Commonly, each unit is individually and independently tested to ensure an application is running as expected

# What is needed to write tests?
- Framework to write tests (e.g, Jasmine or Mocha, Chai...)
- Way to describe the code we are testing
- A tool that allows us to make assertions or state expectations about our code
